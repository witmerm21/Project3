The first folder is "Creating Sequence Database". This contains the code required to sort through the sequences provided and map each of them to their correct taxonomic data. The taxonomic data is then sorted by abundance, and the desired taxonomic groups can be selected for training/testing. TXT files (examples provided in datatxt.zip) must then be created manually via copy/paste from excel for each trial dataset. These TXT files are then read and use to create the final datasets.

The second folder is "Classification Outputs". Within this folder is the folder "Output CSVs", which are the 150 classification outputs from the project. Code provided will take the average of each of these CSV files, then save all the averages to a new CSV, which can then be used for various desired statstics. The Excel sheet used for the project is provided that was created from this CSV. Pictures of each of the ROC curves are also provided.

All code has been modified so all directories that must be changed are at the top of the code.
